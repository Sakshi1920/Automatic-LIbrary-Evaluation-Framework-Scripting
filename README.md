In the new generation of chip design, where time is an important parameter, the complexity of designs grows exponentially. It is also noted that Verification is always considered #the longest part and takes up about 70% of the life cycle of a chip design. Therefore, automatically doing a repetitive task is very important to improve productivity. This is where “scripting” skills are invaluable to any design or verification engineer.
