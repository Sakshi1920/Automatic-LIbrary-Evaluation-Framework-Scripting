In the new generation of chip design, where time is an important parameter, the complexity of designs grows exponentially. It is also noted that Verification is always considered the longest part and takes up about 70% of the life cycle of a chip design. Therefore, automatically doing a repetitive task is very important to improve productivity. This is where “scripting” skills are invaluable to any design or verification engineer.


# Automatic-Library-Evaluation-Framework-Scripting

The repository contains automatic synthesis and implementation of four different verilog files using python scripting language.
The attached file contains jupyter notebook (.ipynb) and different tcl files which are used to run the script.
Three files are obtained:- power.txt, timing.txt and utilization.txt
I have extracted different values from these three files.
The values can be observed in the attached .csv file namely Results_final1.csv.
It can be observed that the time taken to extract these values is reduced because of scripting, hence using python was a great advantage to find 21 different parameters from all four different verilog files.
